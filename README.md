# twitter-bot
Overall Project:

Overall I had created on bot who can reply to the user, follow the user, retweet to the user account and make many other things by using the tweepy documentation, python backend and by flask documentation

How to use this code to check locally on your system?

1) You have to run the file name as wsgi.py by using the code python wsgi.py inside the commond prompt or python shell by using this it will start your server for the flask.

Next part is I created the dataset for storing the user information inside it such as tweets, id's and many more and by using sqlAlchamey you can create the dataset the commonds for making dataset inside python shell or commond prompt.
1) from __init__ import db
2) db.create()

By using init keyword it will take file name as init inside it and then after we created the dataset for storing data.

Next view.py and init.py both plays the important role in storing dataset and calling the dataset using functions.

This is the project ecplanation by using this all things you can run the code on your localhost server.
